1. This breach was very serious because since memo.cgi has all the permissions to run as root, any user with access to it has access to the entire system and could easily wreack havoc. The server should clearly limit access to this file so not just anyone has sudo capabilities. Thus, a specific memo usergroup should be created only for the people who need access to memo. Moreover, the SUID bit should be disabled for memo.cgi to prevent it from having these root capabilities, and the sticky bit should be enabled for the memo directory in the memo usergroup's home directory so users cannot delete each other's files. The path should also be checked for directory traversal to prevent users from accessing content outside the directory.

2. As mentioned earlier, this method would not work because the user can still traverse directories using ".." in the path name after these prefixes. Thus, we still have to prevent backtracking and implement the other safety features mentioned above.

3. This exploit was also interesting. The safety measures against this one were definitely more complicated than the first one and took more thinking like a hacker to figure out. It was also fun to come up with ways I could take control of the system using a simple memo program.
