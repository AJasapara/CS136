For part 3, you are required not to submit an executable exploit, but
instead a transcript of all steps required.

For example, if the task was "log on to CourseWeb", a transcript would
look like:

1. go to http://courseweb.seas.ucla.edu/
2. click LOGIN
3. In the username window, enter your username
4. in the password window, enter your password.
5. Click submit.

The transcript should include *ALL* input or actions required to
perform each task in the assignment.

Q: Show how you can log into an account without knowing any id
numbers ahead of time.
- Set up SSH tunneling and access the login page at http://localhost:8080/cgi-bin/FCCU.php
- Enter '100 OR 100=100 #' in the account ID number (without quotes) and something in password (don't leave it blank!)
- The OR 100=100 makes that part of the SQL query always true and the # makes the rest of the query a comment so the query will always return some user.

Q: Show how you can log into *every* account without knowing any
particular id numbers ahead of time. (You can use any id numbers you
discover during the attack but you can't use your "inside knowledge"
of the SQL server.)
- Using the above methods, log into an account
- Using the drop-down menu of employees, transfer an invalid amount of money (such as -$1)
- The resulting error will have the current account ID, and the targeted employee's ID
- Log out and use that ID to log into that account (by entering 'ID #' in Account ID and something in the password field as above)


Q: Make some account (your choice) wire its total balance to the bank
with routing number "314159265" and account number "271828182845".
- I used the first account I accessed (Camille Cantu) and used the above methods to log into her account
- I then used the above numbers and her entire balance to wire the funds


Q: Explain why you can't create a new account or arbitrarily update
account balances (or show that you can).
We do not have direct access to the backend SQL shell and the queries used with this database primarily use SELECT or other forms of read access. Thus, we cannot insert a new account and such, or arbitrarily update bank balances.

Q: Estimate how much time you spent on this lab (all 3 parts).
While this was a fun lab, this was definitely longer than the first two. I'd say I spent roughly 20 hours from start to finish. Waiting for empty nodes didn't help either.

Fix the vulnerability in the FCCU.php application and any other tasks
in the lab manual.
