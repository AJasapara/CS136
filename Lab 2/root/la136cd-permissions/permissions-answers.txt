Answer the questions from the lab manual in this file.

1. Yes they can if they know the names of the files and use cat. In order to stop this, the files cannot be executable or readable.

2. It means that it can be executed. In the case of directories, this means that the directory can be opened (can cd into).

3. tps since it is the owner.

4. No, since they have no permissions/access to the directory. (I'm assuming this question excludes tps from the non-wheel employees because obviously tps has total access to the directory).

5. It means they have no permissions/access to the directory so they also have no privileges over the files in that directory.

6. No, it isn't safe because larry (or someone posing as him) can not only access these programs from any host, but use an exploit as a sudoer to modify the respective environment variables to let him execute any program. While it is unsafe, there does not seem to be a better alternative.

7. Yes, it is safe because because he would be restricted access only to the restart command for the server since there are no unknown vulnerabilities.

8. Yes, if they utilize the time period between entering the password and interaction with the shell. The shell is created from /etc/passwd which they could modify for additional permissions, and the user is logged in with /etc/profile so they could modify this file to gain sudo access.
